### Name Ideas

*   Medi-Note
*   Med-Sched
*   Ready Medi

### Opinions on Current name: "Medification"

*   Easy to remember, you'd probably get it in Google searches for "medication".
*   Medi - implies information about medicines
*   it fits
*   it clearly states what the app does as well as what it involves which still is understandable.
*   Catchy name + describes the product
*   you know what it is for

#### Disadvantages

*   not obvious what it's about!
*   needs to say what it does

### Feature Ideas

*   Reminder to get more tablets when you run out#

### Target Audience

*   Early stages of dementia
*   Stroke victims with cognitive/ memory issues
*   Forgetful people
*   people taking lots of meds.
*   everyone who take regular medication & need repeat prescriptions.
